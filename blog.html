                <img class="rounded-pic" src="Future.jpg" alt="A person looking toward a distant horizon where the sky meets the sea">

                <p>Last week, I ended with a question: <strong>'Do you trust where your current 1-degree shifts are taking you?'</strong></p>

                <p>For many of us, the honest answer is 'I'm not sure.' We worry. We set a goal, and then we panic that we won't reach it. We dream of a future that feels simultaneously amazing and terrifyingly out of reach. This brings us to the Third and Final Pillar: <strong>The Future.</strong></p>

                <p>We often treat the Future like a fixed destination on a map. A specific job, a certain amount of money. We stare at it, measure our distance from it, and feel anxiety when we're off course. This turns the future into a source of stress, not inspiration. It’s like a ship captain who only stares at the destination, ignoring the wind, the waves, and the rudder in their hands. They will likely crash.</p>

                <p>In our Knowledge Time Machine, the Future is not a target. It is a <strong>horizon</strong>.</p>

                <p>A horizon is not a place you arrive at. It is a line that moves as you move. You can’t control the horizon, but you can absolutely trust that if you sail well today—using your fuel (the past) to steer your ship (the present)—you will reach a new and beautiful horizon.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">The Horizon: Your True Compass</span></p>

                <p>Think of standing on a beach, looking out at the ocean. You see a line where the sky meets the sea—that's the horizon.</p>
                <p>Now, try to walk to it. What happens?</p>
                <p>You keep walking, but the horizon keeps moving forward. You can never reach it. It is not a place you arrive at.</p>
                <p>But what does happen?</p>
                <p>As you walk toward the horizon, your entire view changes. New landscapes appear. You discover coves, rocks, and vistas you couldn't see from where you started. The horizon <em>guides</em> your direction, but your journey is through the actual ground beneath your feet—the present.</p>
                <p>That’s exactly how your future works.</p>

                <p>If you treat the future as a fixed target (like "I must become CEO by 40"), you'll feel constant stress—like trying to reach a horizon that keeps moving. You'll feel like a failure for not "arriving."</p>

                <p>But if you treat the future as a horizon, you understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can't control it, but you can move <em>toward</em> it.</li>
                    <li>It guides your direction in the present.</li>
                    <li>As you move, new opportunities and views (your actual life) unfold along the way.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>'The future is not as important as the present'</strong> because it is a consequence, not a cause.</p>
                <p><strong>'The present is the controller for the future'</strong> is literally our operating manual.</p>
                <p><strong>'The future is just an imagination that never exists. It is just the way we do psychic thinking.'</strong> And what fuels that thinking? The real actions we take in the now.</p>

                <div style="border-top: 2px dashed #000; margin: 30px 0;"></div>

                <p><span class="highlight">Your Final Time Travel Mission</span></p>
                <p>
                    1. <strong>Look at your 1-Degree Shift from last week.</strong> That small action you took.<br>
                    2. <strong>Ask yourself:</strong> 'If I did nothing else but this one small thing consistently, where would I realistically be in one year?'<br>
                    3. <strong>Write that down.</strong> That is a trustworthy future. It’s not a fantasy; it’s a projection based on your present actions. That is what you are actually building.

                <img class="rounded-pic" src="Present.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

                <p>In the past article, I asked you a question: <strong>“What's the very first dial you want to turn on your control panel right now?”</strong></p>

                <p>You must be wondering what the dial and the control panel mean. Let me explain with a simple analogy. Let me explain with a simple analogy.</p>

                <p>When you have a car, you need fuel, and a steering wheel to control where it goes. The Fuel is the Past. It's the energy, the lessons, the "why" from your history. The Steering is the Present. It's the control you have right now to change direction. The Destination is the Future. It's where you're headed as a result.</p>

                <p>Now, let's think bigger. Imagine your life as a ship crossing an ocean. Changing your entire life is not about wrenching the wheel hard to port in a storm. It's about adjusting the rudder by one single degree.</p>

                <p>Now, let's think bigger. Imagine your life as a ship crossing an ocean. Changing your entire life is not about wrenching the wheel hard to port in a storm. It's about adjusting the rudder by one single degree.</p>

                <p>On day one, it looks like nothing has changed. But after 100 miles? 1,000 miles? You will arrive at a completely different continent.</p>

                <p>The Present is your hand on that rudder. The 1-Degree Shift is the tiny, sustainable move you make today.</p>

                <p>The Present is the only point in time where we have real control. The past is a read-only file. The future is a simulation. But right now, this moment, you can choose. You can act.</p>

                <p>The problem is, we often treat the Present as a passive space. We wait for motivation. We wait for Monday. We wait for a sign. But a Time Machine with a full tank of fuel is useless if you never start the engine.</p>

                <p>Our Knowledge Time Machine has a simple control panel. It doesn’t have a ‘Fast Forward’ or ‘Rewind’ button. It only has dials for small, intentional adjustments, the '1-Degree Shift.'</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">How It Works: Your Pilot's Log</span></p>

                <p>Your ‘fuel’ (the lesson from the past) tells you what to adjust. The Present is where you turn the dial.</p>

                <div style="border-top: 2px dashed #000; margin: 20px 0;"></div>

                <p>Fuel: "I learned I regret not practicing coding before the interview."</p>

                <p>Control Panel Adjustment (1-Degree Shift): "Today, I will solve one coding problem."</p>

                <p>The shift is tiny. The direction is everything.</p>

                <p>This is the magic of the Present. You don’t need to change your whole life today. You just need to change one degree of your direction. A 1-degree shift today means you’ll be in a completely different place a year from now.</p>

                <p>That’s real time travel.</p>

                <p>Last week, I asked you a question: <strong>"If you could learn one thing from your past to improve your future, what would it be?"</strong></p>

                <p>Any answer is acceptable, but mine is this: <span class="highlight">learning never ends</span>.</p>

                <p>After I graduated, I thought my learning was finished. I believed I just needed to work and earn money. But I was wrong. While working, we are always learning to keep growing. That's the work of life.</p>

                <p>That moment of realization—that my graduation was a beginning, not an end—was the first time I successfully used my Knowledge Time Machine. I didn't change the past. I changed its <em>meaning</em> for my future.</p>

                <p>"Learning never ends" is the lesson that allows me to adapt to any situation. In the past, I saw my post-graduation mindset as a kind of failure. A failure to keep learning. However, my Time Machine theory suggests that the event wasn't an end. It was <span class="highlight">raw material</span>.</p>

                <p>This brings us to the <span class="highlight">First Pillar of our Time Machine: The Past.</span></p>

                <p>Most of us time travel to the past in the worst way possible. We go there with <strong>regret</strong>. We replay the scene over and over, wishing we could change it. This isn't time travel. It's being haunted. It's like having a time machine and only using it to stand in the rain of a bad day you already lived through. This is why a physical time machine is dangerous. It tempts us to do just that.</p>

                <p>Our Knowledge Time Machine has a different function for the past. <strong>We don't go back to change the event. We go back to understand it.</strong> We are not emotion-driven tourists. We are calm scientists collecting data.</p>

                <p>If you changed the past, it would likely make things worse. Every possible outcome happens for a reason. The past you have already endured is the one that made you who you are. Changing it would erase the strength you built by getting through it. This is the proof of the axiom: <em>"The past is the history that we can learn from."</em></p>

                <p>Your past is not a chain that holds you back. It is a <span class="highlight">library</span>. Every experience, especially the difficult ones, is a book full of data on how life works and who you are. Your mission is not to rewrite those books, but to study them.</p>

                <p>Be a scientist of your own history. Pick one past event, big or small, and ask it: <strong>"What did you come to teach me?"</strong> Don't look for blame. Look for the lesson. That lesson is the first piece of fuel for your Time Machine.</p>

                <p>Next article, we'll talk about the Second Pillar: The Present, where we learn how to use this engine and controls.</p>

                <p>Yes, the equation to build a time machine is solved.</p>

                <p>Before jumping into it, I remember watching movies as a child that showed people traveling through time. It was amazing! The idea that we could see real dinosaurs in the past or flying cars in the future was magical. As Malaysians, many of us have even drawn those flying cars that were our symbol of the future.</p>

                <p>Being born in the 90s and beyond is amazing because we had those dreams. And now, in the present, we are essentially living in that "future." While we might not have flying cars exactly as we imagined, when we look closely, we see so much progress compared to the 90s. The world has improved in countless ways.</p>

                <p>And now, I've found a real time machine. It's been inside us all along.</p>

                <p>Before I discovered it, there had to be an equation and I've solved it:</p>

                <div class="equation">Time Machine = Knowledge</div>

                <p>The derivation of the equation might sound complex, but we can actually understand it easily because it's always been a part of us. Yes, that's correct!</p>

                <p>Before we get into the derivation, think about this. If you went back in time and changed one small thing, you could accidentally prevent your own birth! A physical time machine is a reckless, chaotic tool. Chasing that dream is a distraction from the real time travel we can all do right now.</p>

                <p>Okay, now let's dive in: <span class="highlight">Time Machine = Knowledge</span>.</p>

                <p>Every machine or device developed by engineers has a specific function. Think about the transformation from the steam train to the autonomous cars we have today. The reason for this progress is always the same. We want to improve our lives, to make things better.</p>

                <p>So, why would we want to build a time machine? What would it be for? Would you want to see the past or the future? Maybe you'd want to change it, or maybe you'd just want to visit. But I can tell you, changing the past wouldn't bring you the benefits you think it would. However, based on my equation, I can build a real time machine.</p>

                <p>My time machine isn't made of gears and clockwork. It's made of <span class="highlight">Knowledge</span>. When I read a biography, I'm traveling into the past to learn from someone like Einstein's mistakes. When I learn a new skill today, I'm twisting the dials to send my future self to a better destination. Knowledge is the safe, powerful, and real key to time travel.</p>

                <p>This isn't just a philosophical idea. It's a practical tool for building a better life. Over the next few weeks, I will share the 3 pillars of creating this time machine: The Past, The Present, and The Future. We'll also explore the traditional definition of a time machine versus my philosophical definition.</p>

                <p>But for now, I want you to start thinking like a time traveler.</p>
